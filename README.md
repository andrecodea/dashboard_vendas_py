# Sales Dashboard
In this project, I used the libraries Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly Express.
The goal of the project is to obtain a structured view of certain information, which includes:

Monthly revenue by branch;
Revenue by product type;
Performance of payment methods;
Total revenue;
Average branch ratings.

## Development Process
1. We will import the "supermarket_sales" dataset and read and display this CSV file using the Pandas library.
2. We will format and sort the data for better readability.
3. We will create filters for displaying the established objectives using Pandas.
4. We will create the visual interface elements with Streamlit, including columns, checkboxes, and the page structure.
5. We will create DataFrames, group the data, and display it through charts.
6. We will display bar and pie charts with the grouped data.
